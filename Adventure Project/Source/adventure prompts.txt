you slowly meterialize in a dense rainforest standing on a black mossy boulder to the right of
a thin stream. water condeses on your skin, the humidity of the air is so great that it feels
as though you are breathing water. You seem to be wearing hiking shoes, a fanny pack, some kaki pants and
a black t-shirt. The rules of the game are simple, the king almighty will give 10 pounds of gold to the person
who frees his son from the island of hirichomalala, the story goes that when the kings son was practicing
administration on the small chunk of land his father hand lent him (namely the island hirichomalala) the highly
narrcisistic, dumb and introverted son stumbled apon a merchant selling a single celled parasite that infects its
host and takes control of their nervouse system making them repeate the tasks most dear to them,
thankfully the parasite did not have any way to spread other than from a blood transfusion, the parasite
can identify non infected humans because of the non repetetiveness or change in behavior,
a parisite that loves to talk to people must always or is highly extroverted can neverchange and become
highly introverted, this could raise suspision and be killed by the other parasites.

instead of incinerating the vial your highneses son ingected it using a syringe into the merchant sure enough the
merchant now taken over by the parasite treid to choke your highneses son but he narrowly escaped shutting the
palace doors, if only the kings son hadnt thrown the syringe out of the palace the parasite would have no way to
spread but when the merchant saw the syringe on the floor he or it started doing blood transfutions with all
the residents of the town soon everyone was infected, mindlessly reapeting the same actions over and over and over
for some they found joy in raising children, others eating, others playing cards and others all three the
island could have been bombed, set fire to or even abandand, but now that the prince was still alive and
sending messeges through pigeons that his supply of pastreis needed to be restocked
